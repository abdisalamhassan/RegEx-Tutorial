# Become a regular with RegEx!

To begin lets start with the term Regex and what it stands for.RegEx is short for 'Regular Expressions'. A regex is a string of text(which can include letters,numbers and charactars).

RegEx can help us sift through lots of data by finding the exact text that we ar looking for. Lets say you're looking through postal codes for a city. This list of data would would daunting to look through. But what if you knew what the postal code started with you could use that to aid your search using regex. You would match the information you hav with the information your looking for.

Regex is used in a plethora of languages such as:
 -Java
 -Python
 -Ruby
 -Javascript
 -PHP
 

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors in boats are devices that are attached on bots that are heavy weights used by captains to connect to the seabed below to stop the boat from moving.

That same logic applies to anchors in regex. They can let a user specify that you want to match digit in a specific spot in a line of text. It is important to know that not all anchors are created equal. The are string anchors, line anchors and attempt anchors.

-String anchors include the caret syntax(^) and the dollar syntax($). The carter syntax matches the start of the regex string, whereas the dollar syntax matches the end of the regex sting.

So in the following sting (password123) the ^ would match with the letter 'p' and the $ would match with the number '3'
